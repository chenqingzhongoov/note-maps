## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.6] - 2020-12-06

### Added

- New Dart packages under `dart/...` and Flutter packages under `flutter/...`.
- GraphQL schema at `api/note.graphqls`, used [gqlgen][] to generate Go code,
  [artemis][] to generate Dart code for new Flutter package
  `flutter/nm_gql_go_link`, and some awkward glue to make them fit.
- [Zefyr][] as a subtree in `third_party/zefyr` so that custom
  attributes can be supported.
- Dart packages `dart/nm_delta` and `dart/nm_delta_notus` as an attempt to integrate with [Zefyr][]'s data models.
- Documents attempting to hash out some of the ideas here: [docs/data-model.md](docs/data-model.md)
  [docs/design.md](docs/design.md)
  [docs/like-editing-a-document.md](docs/like-editing-a-document.md)
  [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md).
- [GPM][] config to help manage Dart packages.
- Makefile and some `*.mk` files for [GNU Make][] based builds.
- [Nix][] scripts under `nix`, partly managed by [Niv][], for consistent
  versions of build tools including a custom `dart` package to support builds on Darwin.
