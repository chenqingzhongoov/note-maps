# Until travis-ci.org supports Nix on MacOS, we have to use separte jobs:
jobs:
  include:
  - os: linux
    dist: xenial
    language: nix
    nix: 2.3.9
    env: FLUTTER_BUILD=appbundle
    cache:
      directories:
      - $HOME/nix.store
      - $HOME/.cache
    before_install:
    - sudo mkdir -p /etc/nix
    - echo "substituters = https://cache.nixos.org/ file://$HOME/nix.store" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf > /dev/null
    - echo 'require-sigs = false' | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf > /dev/null
    - mkdir -p out/tmp
    install:
    - unset GOROOT ; nix-shell --run 'make -e download'
    script:
    - unset GOROOT ; nix-shell --run 'make -e lint test build'
    before_cache:
    - mkdir -p $HOME/nix.store
    - nix copy --to file://$HOME/nix.store -f default.nix buildInputs nativeBuildInputs
  - os: osx
    osx_image: xcode12.2
    language: generic
    env: FLUTTER_BUILD=ios FLUTTER=$HOME/flutter/bin/flutter DART=$HOME/flutter/bin/dart
    before_install:
    - git clone -b 1.24.0-6.0.pre --depth 1 https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git $HOME/flutter
    install:
    - make -e download
    script:
    - make -e lint test build OUT=./result
